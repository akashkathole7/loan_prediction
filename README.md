Load Prediction

The Load Prediction project is a machine learning model that predicts the power load for a given period of time based on historical data. The project can be used by power companies or facilities to optimize their power usage and reduce energy waste.

Requirements
The Load Prediction project requires the following software and libraries:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
Installation
To install the Load Prediction project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/akashkathole7/loan_prediction.git.
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter Notebook using jupyter notebook and navigate to the load_prediction.ipynb file.
Usage
To use the Load Prediction project, follow these steps:

Open the load_prediction.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Load your historical data into the data variable using the load_data() function.
Preprocess the data using the preprocess_data() function.
Split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function.
Train the machine learning model using the train_model() function.
Evaluate the model using the evaluate_model() function.
Use the predict_load() function to predict the power load for a given period of time.
